I've been building companies in the decentralized web space for several years; including product developement, team operations, and business development.

As one of the cofounders and COO of Fleek alongside Harrison Hines, our CEO, and Janison Sivarajah, our CTO, we're building the worlds leading decentralized development platform. We all previously cofounded blockchain companies or dapps beforehand and came together to focus on the vision of managing your dapp in one place.

At ConsenSys I was part of the founding team of Balanc3, which was the "Quickbooks for Crypto". There I led product development releasing the production app meeting the full crypto bookkeeper Product-Market-Fit in about a year, and led business development selling the product to 70+ dApps and $1.2 M ARR in 5 months. 

My experience in the blockchain and decentralized tech industry originally began in 2016 building a dapp on a private instance of Quorum using Azure to improve the dining dollar student experience at Fordham (while starting the Fordham blockchain community, Fordham FinTech Network). Mid 2016 was my "down the rabbit hole" experience in which I read numerous whitepapers, met key people based in NYC (thankful for meetups!), and started building my own products.
